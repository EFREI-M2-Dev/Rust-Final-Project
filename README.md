## Debug

To enable debugging, follow these steps:

1. **Open two terminals**:

    - In the **first terminal**, execute the `tty` command to identify the correct terminal path.
    - Copy the value of the terminal path from the output and paste it into the `tty_path` field in `config.toml`.

2. **Execute the program**:

    - In the **second terminal**, run the program as usual by executing:

        ```
        cargo run
        ```

    This will ensure the application sends debug messages to the specified terminal.
